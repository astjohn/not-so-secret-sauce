    <h1>Welcome to Highgroove's Not-So-Secret Sauce!</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
  One of the most important things we believe in at Highgroove is sharing.
  Internally, we share just about everything, whether it's a funny picture of a cat
  (<a href="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/funny-pictures-taco-cat-is-a-palindrome.jpg">exhibit a</a>),
  a cool new rubygem, the latest best-practice on that hip new thing, or a cool bash trick somebody just learned.
  All these little things help us to stay informed and involved in our ecosystem, and as a result,
  we're all continually improving.
  </p>

  <p>
  Unfortunately, a lot of this mindshare doesn't always make it out of the confines of our Campfire room.
  Being the sort of people who believe you truly can hug every cat, we decided that we should work
  harder to share some of our documentation with everyone.
  What you'll find here is a handful of documents that we've handcrafted over time that all help us
  to do our jobs better, and we're hoping they can help you too.
  </p>

  <h2>But what about the secret sauce?</h2>
  <p>
  We've got to keep some tricks up our sleeve.
  Of course, we're also <a href="http://highgroove.theresumator.com/apply">hiring</a> if you <em>really</em> need to know
  what makes us awesome (besides tacos, of course).
