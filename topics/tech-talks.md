# Tech Talks

## Intention

* A fun presentation on any topic under the sun that is some combination of new,
  relevant, interesting, or obscure.
* Presented by someone that is a subject matter expert, or that has prepared
  themselves enough to present and answer in-depth questions.
* Less than an hour long,  fitting in two 30 minute talks each time would be
  ideal.
* Marketing for Highgroove!  These should be interesting to people outside of
  Highgroove, should add knowledge to our community, and should show how great
  it is to work here because we get to attend these. 

## Attending

* Every week on Friday at 2pm at the Highgroove Atlanta Office.
* Totally optional, and can be viewed later if you make it optional.
* Broadcast live via GoToMeeting and recorded for watching later on Vimeo.
* non-Highgroove employees are also welcome to attend, but they must commit to
  presenting a topic at some point in the future

## Presenting

* All Highgroove employees are responsible for presenting a topic once a
  quarter, and it's totally ok to present more frequently than that. 
* We also welcome non-Highgroove employees to present.
* Topic ideas are in Pivotal Tracker. Add your ideas there, and pick ideas from
  there to present on if you need inspiration.
* Topic needs to be posted with the meeting invite earlier in the week so that
  people can decide if they want to attend.
* Unless the presentation is Highgroove Only, Presentations should not include
  Highgroove Confidential Information when non-Highgroove employees are present.
  This includes mentions of client names and confidential aspects of those
  projects.  Highgroove Confidential Information related questions should be
  held to the end once recording has stopped and non-Highgroove employees have
  left.
* Turn off your email, turn off your timer, turn off your growl notifications,
  and don't mention any of our clients unless you have asked permission to do so!
* Once complete, upload the video to the Highgroove Vimeo account:
  http://vimeo.com/highgroove . Credentials are in the credentials repository
* Videos (including ones with client confidential info that we can't put on
  Vimeo) are on the internal server for access by Highgroovers.
