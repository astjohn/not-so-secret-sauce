# Tech Talks

## Intention

* A fun presentation on any topic under the sun that is some combination of new, relevant, interesting, or obscure.
* Presented by someone that is a subject matter expert, or that has prepared themselves enough to present and answer in-depth questions.
* Less than an hour long,  fitting in two 30 minute talks each time would be ideal.
* Marketing for us!  These should be interesting to people outside of our organization, should add knowledge to our community, and should show how great it is to work here because we get to attend these.

## Attending

* Totally optional.
* Broadcast live via GoToMeeting and recorded for watching later on Vimeo.
* Anyone is welcome to attend as long as they commit to presenting a topic at some point in the future.

## Presenting

* All employees are asked to regularly present, and we invite people from other companies to present
* Topic needs to be posted with the meeting invite earlier in the week so that people can decide if they want to attend.
* Presentations should not include Company Confidential Information. This includes mentions of client names and confidential aspects of those projects.  Company Confidential Information related questions should be held to the end once recording has stopped.
* Turn off your email, turn off your timer, turn off your growl notifications, and don't mention any of our clients unless you have asked permission to do so!
