##Hiring is Important

Hiring is hard.  Good companies hire slow, and fire fast.

Here's our Hiring Process, that we've been following for 2 years, with very few modifications since inception.

* A Job Application is filled out.  We use [The Resumator](http://theresumator.com) and have a [Highgroove Jobs](http://highgroove.com/jobs.html) page listing all open positions.
* We review Applications for the "3 Questions" ("why a new job?", your favorite ruby method, and previous salaries for last 2 jobs)
* We perform a Telephone Pre-screen of 5 Questions
* We schedule a Face-to-face meeting to perform a modified version of [top-grading](http://www.topgrading.com/) of career/work history, followed by pair programming
* We perform at least 2 Reference Checks (not family or friends)
* A job offer extended via personalized offer letter, or declined via form letter

At all points along the way, many do not make the cut to the next step.
