## Vacation Time

Unlimited within reason. In order to accommodate vacations (if you don't want to be responsible for results during that time) we require that you give us 4-6 weeks notice. Please send vacation notices to the Office Manager AND indicate your vacation in the company vacation calendar.

If a trip opportunity comes up at the last minute, talk to your client(s).  You could:

* Take a last-minute vacation and don't work at all.  The client will be billed for a reduced strength iteration, and you will not be responsible for working while on your trip. This is only acceptable if your client is 100% ok with a reduced strength iteration! Let the office manager know that the client should be billed less.
* Take a last-minute vacation and work some.  The client will be billed for a reduced strength iteration (e.g. you are 'out' on W/R/F, but only take 1 day of vacation because you'll get done 2 days of work).  This is only acceptable if your client is 100% ok with a reduced strength iteration! Let the office manager know that the client should be billed less.
* Take a working vacation and get your work done.  Let the client know that your 'hours' will be different, but that they shouldn't lower expectations.  This sounds like a good idea but working on trips isn't that great, so be sure you know what you're getting into. Feel free to do this whenever you like, but it's not recommended.

Remember, you can work from anywhere anytime you want. You don't have to take vacation to go to the beach! You are still responsible for being an "A" player so we know that you will use the unlimited vacation policy wisely!

If you're on vacation for part of an iteration, you're still responsible for results for that iteration. For example, if you're out from Monday to Friday of a week, you still have code reviews to do for the first and section iteration that you're missing part of.  Do the first one on the previous Friday before you leave. It'll be short, but that's ok! You could also get someone else on your team to do your code review for you, as long as you plan ahead and it's not last minute.

## Paid Time Off (PTO) / Sick Time

Unlimited within reason.  Everyone gets sick, doesn't feel well, or can't perform at 100%, all the time.  In order to communicate with clients and adjust expectations, please notify Client(s) and the Office Manager as soon as possible so we can alter the results (both billing and expected output).

PTO is not tracked according to our ROWE policy. We expect you to manage your time off accordingly and as a guide, most companies our size provide up to 15 days PTO.

General PTO Rules/Guidelines:

* If visibly sick or contagious, do not come into the office (or go to co-work space, coffee shops, or anywhere) to spread germs.
* Let your client(s) know you're sick, out, and unavailable to work.  You can use the term PTO (Paid Time Off) because that is what they understand.
* Get better, get rested, or schedule doctor or clinic visit so you can come back and kick ass.
