Style Points
============

This is the style guideline for the [Highgroove blog](http://highgroove.com/blog.html). Rules are meant to be broken, of course, and not all posts should have to satisfy every single rule to the letter, but if we keep up with this (and keep writing!), there should be a great consistency in both the quality and frequency of the posts. The post should communicate its thesis effectively. It should have a point it's working toward, and by the end make sure that point is made. The hook or intro does not have to relate to the point - see [Derek's Scout intro](http://highgroove.com/articles/2008/01/22/web-app-service-plan-subscriptions.html) in which he talks about Blink - but by the end everything should be clear and concise.


## Keep it Simple

The post should be simple. It should not try and take on too many ideas at once. If you have lots of ideas for one post, save them for new posts!

When possible, use "we" instead of "I". This will reaffirm the idea that Highgroove has a consistent style and method. (For instance, you wouldn't say, "We went to Disneyworld," but you would say, "After I went to Disneyworld, I was reminded of how we at Highgroove....")

Don't be afraid to state opinions - if anything, seek to state opinions! (This way is better...this works well...projects are more successful when...). However, it's probably best not to be overtly negative (This app. blows because....I hate working with people that...), or spend too much time dwelling on anything that isn't the Highgroove way. 

## What to say

Don't be too technical, but don't shy away from talking tech. If it shows how Highgroove approaches a problem, or why Rails is the way to go, or how simple complex things can be with good thought process.

If you're being technical, include code. It's easy to talk about code and best-practices without example, but a good example is the most illustrative tool for communicating code-related subjects. Include a Gist in your post to take advantage of nice formatting and syntax highlighting (via `<script src="https://gist.github.com/[Gist number].js"></script>`). Attempt to make your code no more than 80 columns wide where applicable to eliminate scrolling the Gist to see all of the code.

Don't be afraid of controversy or convention.

Feel free to talk about things besides work... at least in the beginning of a post. Clients want to know we're people, too, and so if something that happens in the rest of your life relates to work, write about it. Just be sure to relate it back to work and Highgroove. Otherwise this is just a personal blog with no reason to be on the Highgroove site. 

Open-ended posts that encourage feedback are nice. Perhaps even ending some posts with a line like, "What are some of the ways you've found this to be true?" is a nice move.


## Make it pretty

A Picture is worth a thousand words. Post a picture, diagram, chart, or screenshot that relates to the theme, or shows off one of the things you’re talking about. Easiest way is to make it small (200x200 or smaller), and align it right (see previous posts for examples). Do a google image search or use flickr creative commons search for publicly usable posts. Use [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) or a screenshare tool so you’re not hot-linking from a site. Try a [Creative Commons Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/) using flickr or wikipedia for images. Even Creative Commons licensed photos require attribution (e.g., a link back to the photographer's website).

Above all things, make sure the post reaffirms the (forthcoming) brand and philosophy of Highgroove. The blog is a place where we can show we're people and do something creative, but its essential purpose is to cement the Highgroove way of thinking and doing in the reader's mind. It's also the place where we confirm all the big ideas we talk about in the "how" section of the page. 

Use a simple, unique title for the post.  Keep them unique and short (under 75 characters) to really grab your readers' attention and maximize the SEO benefits.  (from a website "grader" report).
Publishing

## Get Feedback

We peer review software, so we also peer review blog posts. When you deliver a blog post, commit it with the published flag set to false and deliver the blog post story in Pivotal Tracker. Then, someone else will review your post and (hopefully) reject it with a list of changes, suggestions. You'll re-deliver until everything looks good, and whoever accepts your story will also be responsible for setting it to published and deploying it to the tubes. 


## Ship it

After the post is live, post it on Facebook (as of right now this will auto-tweet it as well), or just post on Twitter.  Retweet your own post to get it started circulating.  Get the word out by submitting it to relevant, focused sites/community blogs/etc.

Some suggestions based on topic:
@highgroove twitter: all blog posts
Ruby Flow: technical posts involving Ruby
Hacker News: business, methodology, sales, certain technical posts that fit the HN environment

## First Post and General Suggestions

Suggestions for your first post: convey your first impressions, how things are different, what's awesome at Highgroove, what's more awesome at Highgroove, or whatever strikes your fancy including technical topics.

Quarterly goals, which are set by the team, usually include X posts per week.  These posts are randomly assigned but remember, these are team goals.  You can volunteer to take someone else's assigned blog post, ask for volunteers or even release yours even though it isn't assigned.
