Style Points
============

This is the style guideline for our company blog. Rules are meant to be broken,
of course, and not all posts should have to satisfy every single rule to the
letter, but we're looking for consistency in both the quality and frequency of the posts. 

##What's the point?

The post should communicate its thesis effectively. It should have a point it's working toward, and by the end, you should make sure that point is made. The hook or intro does not have to relate to the point - see [Derek's Scout
intro](http://highgroove.com/articles/2008/01/22/web-app-service-plan-subscriptions.html)
in which he talks about Blink - but by the end, everything should be clear and
concise.

## Keep it simple

The post should be simple. It should not try and take on too many ideas at once.
If you have lots of ideas for one post, save them for new posts!

When possible, use "we" instead of "I". This will reaffirm the idea that we as a
company have a consistent style and method. (For instance, you wouldn't say, "We
went to Disneyworld," but you would say, "After I went to Disneyworld, I was
reminded of how at my company we....")

Don't be afraid to state opinions - if anything, seek to do so! Don't be afraid to say "this way is better" or "projects are more successful when..." On the other hand, it's best to not be overtly negative, so steer clear of saying things like "this app sucks because" or "I hate working with people who..."

## What to say

Feel free to talk about things besides work, at least in the beginning of a
post. Clients want to know we're people, too, and so if something that happens
in the rest of your life relates to work, write about it. Just be sure to relate
it back to work. Otherwise, this could become just a personal blog with no reason to be on the company site.

Don't be too technical, but don't shy away from talking tech. It shows that we not only know how to approach a problem, but that we know how to explain it to a diverse audience. Feel free to talk about why Rails (or anything else) is the way to go, for example, but back it up by showing that complex things can made simple be with good thought process.

If you're being technical, include code. Include a Gist in your post to take
advantage of nice formatting and syntax highlighting (via `<script
src="https://gist.github.com/[Gist number].js"></script>`). Attempt to make your
code no more than 80 columns wide, to eliminate scrolling in the Gist.

Don't be afraid of controversy or convention.

If you're stuck and having a hard time coming up with a topic, check  Pivotal Tracker for stories labelled "blog" or "blog-idea."

Open-ended posts that encourage feedback are nice. Ending some posts with a line like, "What are some of the ways you've found this to be true?" is a nice move.

Use a simple, unique title for the post. Keep them unique and short (under 75
characters) to really grab your readers' attention and maximize the SEO
benefits. 

## Make it pretty

A picture is worth a thousand words. Post a picture, diagram or
screenshot that relates to the theme, or shows off one of the things you're
talking about. The easiest way is to make it small (200x200 or smaller), and align
it right (see previous posts for examples). Do a Google image search or use
Flickr creative commons for publicly usable posts. Use
[Skitch](http://skitch.com/) or a screenshare tool so you're not hot-linking
from a site. Even Creative Commons licensed photos require attribution, so include a link
at the bottom of the post to the photographer's website.

Above all things, make sure the post reaffirms the company brand and
philosophy. The blog is a place where we can show we're people and do something
creative, but its essential purpose is to cement our way of thinking and doing
in the reader's mind.

## Get Feedback

We peer review software, so we also peer review blog posts. When you deliver a
blog post, commit it with the published flag set to false and let the marketing manager know. Then the marketing manager will review your post, make comments and changes, and then submit to the rest of the team for a final review. 

If the review will take place in Github, make sure you commit your post with the content line wrapped (your editor should be able to do this for you easily) so that your reviewer
can easily read the post and comment on specific lines. Prose.io is another option for submitting and editing posts. 

*Note that if you use Prose to edit, you should avoid apostrophes in your file name. Prose hates apostrophes in file names and won't allow access to your post. Do your team a favor and avoid them if you can.*

Whoever accepts your story will also be responsible for setting it to
published and deploying it to the tubes.

## Ship it

After the post is live, the marketing manager will share the post on Facebook and Twitter. Retweet and share your own post to get
it started circulating. Get the word out by submitting it to relevant, focused
sites, community blogs. etc.

Some suggestions based on topic:
Ruby Flow: technical posts involving Ruby
Hacker News: business, methodology, sales, certain technical posts that fit the
HN environment

## First Post and General Suggestions

Suggestions for your first post: convey your first impressions, how things are
different, what's awesome at work, what's more awesome at work, or whatever
strikes your fancy, including technical topics. 

Quarterly goals, which are set by the team, usually include X posts per week.
These posts are randomly assigned but remember, these are team goals. You can
volunteer to take someone else's assigned blog post, ask for volunteers or even
release yours even though it isn't assigned.
