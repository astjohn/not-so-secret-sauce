# What We Do

We do Agile development, which means that we build software based on business
stories (actual descriptions of the functionality required) to ensure that we're
delivering value at every step -- and that time, effort, and budgets are
controlled very carefully. Iterations and point based estimations help
developers estimate work appropriately, and help them to not promise on things
they can't deliver. It also helps clients prioritize work, based on the features
that matter most. Lastly, it ensures that together, we can launch software at
any time with the functionality that has been completed so far. Any additional
features can be added incrementally through additional full, 50% or floating
iterations.

# A Formal Definition

  "Agile development is a style of software development that emphasizes customer
  satisfaction through continuous delivery of functional software. Based on a
  variety of iterative development disciplines including extreme programming
  (XP), agile methods put developers to work in small teams to tight budgets and
  short timescales. In contrast to traditional software development methods,
  agile developers liaise continuously with business clients, aiming to deliver
  working software as frequently as every week during a project, and welcome
  changes to the requirement in response to evolving business needs."

The key point here is that the process welcomes change. It’s okay to change your
mind halfway through developing a set of features, if you sell another feature,
or customers ask for another feature, that’s actually encouraged. You shouldn’t
be penalized for responding to change, but you should have a neat way to see how
changes in the form of additions of stories and subtractions of stories affect
when things get done, and how quickly they can be completed.

# The Iteration

An Iteration comprises several components, and contains all <a
href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">12 principles of Agile
development</a>:

* 1 Project Manager / Lead Developer, supported by the entire team
* Weekly kickoff meetings - to retrospect on the last iteration, plan the
  current iteration, and prioritize the backlog
* Code Reviews / Technical Audits - each week, a different developer code
  reviews the commits and project from a technical and consulting standpoint
* Pair Programming - each week, a different developer pairs with the lead
  developer to assist in the development, quality, and process.
* Open Source Usage - every project benefits from the use and contributions to
  open-source development
* Retrospectives - randomly assigned “retrospectives” of iterations take an
  outside-in approach to examine productivity and other aspects, and recommend
  improvements
* Testing, Automated Deployments - every project is deployable, and contains a
  working test suite
* Phone / Email Support - for urgent bugs, fixes, and questions, the support
  phone number are available during Iterative development.
