title: Secret Sauce
---

Sometimes you do have to have a *little bit* of secret sauce.

With the secret sauce, we have a single private repo with
individual directories for all the secret sauce.
We document how to get to this repository in our
Employee Handbook and explain some of what it does.

Inside the repository itself, we provide some
information about all the included modules in the
README, and provide rake tasks to do all of the
management.

For example, we have scripts to automatically
dump stories into Pivotal Tracker.
We also have our custom Propane hacks and
a rake task to install them correctly.
